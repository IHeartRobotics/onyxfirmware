Crypto library simulator

Also the basis for integrating crypto libraries into the geiger counter.

At the moment, cryptlib contains an x86-native compilation of the beecrypt
library with some tweaks for porting to STM32/embedded use, mostly having
to do with memory management and allocation. 

The program you are interested in is testBlock. This will test that the
private key block created by the key generator can in fact be read and
used by the crypto algorithm for RSA operations. It reads in the coefficients
n, e, d, p, q, and performs a single public key encryption and private
key decryption on a single piece of test data. It's enough to verify that
the coefficients are correct (if they weren't, the operation would totally
fail), which is good enough for burning into the ROM and use in the future.

The final implementation can choose not to use beecrypt, this is just provided
as a reference simulation to verify that, for example, the private key
isn't being stored in some incorrect format or encrypted in a way that we
can't recover inside the STM32 for later use.
