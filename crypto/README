Building and running this requires the following packages:

gpg
uuid-dev

and optionally 
rng-tools

if you're not getting enough randomness and want to cheat by using
urandom (which is technically bad practice but okay for this
application, I'd love to see the paper about how someone managed to
actually figure out the random stream used to generate these keys and
mount a real attack cracking them).

to get (fake) randomness quickly
sudo apt-get install rng-tools
sudo echo "HRNGDEVICE=/dev/urandom" >> /etc/default/rng-tools
sudo /etc/init.d/rng-tools start
