safecastgeiger
==============

A firmware project for the safecast geiger counter http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2218

Building
========

The initial codebase was forked from the libmaple project. This provides board support for the STM32 microcontroller. libmaple has been modified to suit the purposes of this project, support for the STM32F103RET6 which this geiger counter uses was added. A few of the functions provided by libmaple have the potential to block under certain error conditions, this has been patched. libmaple also comes with a C++ wrapper library called "Wirish" for the most part this has been removed.

To build the software you need a ARM G++ compiler toolchain that targets bare metal. We have been using the Codesourcey tools:

In particular the 32bit Linux binary distribution: gcc-arm-none-eabi-latest-linux32.tar.gz

To build the codebase you may want to download/extract this and add it to your path. You should then be able to run make in the firmware subdirectory to build a firmware image (safecast.bin).

To program the firmware you can use the tool provided in the firmware_loader subdirectory. To build it type "make". The script "test" containing a usage example.
