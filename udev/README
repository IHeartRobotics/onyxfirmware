udev rules for auto-programming devices when plugged in

To use:

sudo cp 99-safecast.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/
sudo cp safecast-autoprog /usr/sbin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/sbin/safecast-autoprog
sudo cp safecast-timeout /usr/sbin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/sbin/safecast-timeout
sudo cp safecast-update /usr/sbin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/sbin/safecast-update

cp monitor-burn.desktop ~/Dekstop   # if you want the quicklaunch icon to monitor burning as it happens
sudo cp S99touch /etc/rc2.d/        # or to whatever your runlevel is, this script restores /tmp/safecast.log after a reboot
cp safecast-update.desktop ~/Desktop
# note that you'll have to manually grant exec permissions to these icons
# right click on icon and go to properties->permissions and tick "allow executing file as program"

This has been tested under Ubuntu 10.04 LTE and Ubuntu 12.04.

No auto-install script is provided because your life will suck
if you accidentally install this on the wrong machine. Install
only if you think you know what you're doing.

Note that there is a very hard assumption in these scripts that
the root path to the git tree is

/home/safecast/bunniegeiger

Sorry for the hard-coding, but this is intended to run only on
one machine in the world anyways (the factory burning machine).
