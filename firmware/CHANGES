Changes for release 7 (4th October 2012)

Japanese language support
smoothing to reduce jitter on battery icon
tick box for some toggle menu items (audio on/off)
screen dims after 10 seconds of inactivity
serial interface for debugging.
bugfix: in aggregate/avg mode, average CPM can leave artefacts on screen
bugfix: black line in the middle of the battery icon - after many hours of debugging, appears to be display fault on my unit. Need to verify this.
Support for Roentgens display instead of Sieverts
Becquerel mode
Add additional Japanese language translations.
bugfix: it's occasionally possible to jump out of the current screen and back to home without trigger a screen clear. I'm not sure what triggers this bug. Requires further investigation. --- Appears to be triggered by pressing both back and home at the same time.
bugfix: If I mash buttons a lot I can get the header and other display items to stop working.
bugfix: in settings, brightness. When selected the SaveBrightness item causes a flashing box to appear where the lock icon is.
